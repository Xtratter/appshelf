## 1.2 — 2026-09-28

- **Choose which apps go into the list**: "Choose apps…" in the save dialog opens a list with checkboxes, search and "Select all / Select none" (it applies to the apps found by the search)
- The choice is remembered and applies to every save, "Share" and autosave; the summary shows how many apps are left out, and they look dimmed in the main list
- "Leave out of the list" / "Include in the list" in the app card

## 1.1 — 2026-09-28

- Tap the "AppShelf" title to switch to the next theme, long-press it to go back to the standard one; a hint shows which theme is on

## 1.0.1 — 2026-09-28

- The "Autosave" button in the summary no longer wraps and gets cut off: it shows ✓ when autosave is on, and the text shrinks to fit
